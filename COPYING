That's ok, other GNU software also includes routines under the
modified BSD license (e.g. the GNU C Library). Just add the notice in
the affected files with a note "Based on original code from LAPACK:
....".  If there are files where you have some independently written
routines it may make sense to split them so it is clear which parts
are covered each license.  

I will add the disclaimer into the reference manual.
