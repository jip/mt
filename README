'Matrix toolbox' addon for J language

mt is a set of routines for solving some problems in matrix
algebra: transforming, decomposing, reducing to condensed
form, factorization, equation solving, function applying,
condition number estimating. Its algorithms are based on
those from LAPACK [1], RRQR [2, 3] and SLICOT [4] libraries.
